## Project goals ##

Help people decide which streaming service should they choose based on their preferences.

Use Python and Tableau to display my data analytics skills and knowledge.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Project provides answers to two following questions ####

Question 1:
“Which streaming service should I choose based on my general watching preferences?”

Answer 1:
‘Streaming Services Data Analysis’ dashboard provides all important information regarding six different 
streaming services including Amazon Prime, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix and Paramount+. The dashboard 
provides information for each individual streaming service such as: Total Movies and Series ratio, 
Total Movies and Series by genres, Total Movie and Series ratings (from IMDB and TMDB), 
Total Movies and Series by release year, Parental Guidelines ratings, Total Movies and Series by Country.


Question 2:
“I want to watch Movies or Series by specific Actor or Director, which streaming service should I choose?”

Answer 2:
‘Search Movies or Series by Actor/Director on Streaming services’ dashboard enables you to search 
Movies or Series titles by specific Actor or Director on six streaming services (Amazon Prime, Disney+, 
HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix and Paramount+). After selecting specific Actor or Director, list of titles and 
bar chart displays movies and series from specified Actor or Director across all streaming services. 
After you select a title from the list you will also get all important information about that title 
such as: release year, country, runtime, genres, IMDB, TMDB and PG rating, Description, 
Number of seasons if applicable and on which streaming services can you find this title.

## Project steps: ##
	1. Download streaming services data in csv format from Kaggle.com
	2. Import csv files into Python
	3. Data cleaning and validation in Python by using Pandas and Numpy
	4. Preliminary EDA in Python by using Matplotlib and Seaborn
	5. Export all merged csv files from Python to excel file by using Openpyxl
	6. Import excel file into Tableau to create two interactive dashboards
	7. Upload all project related data to GitHub and publish on GitHub Pages
